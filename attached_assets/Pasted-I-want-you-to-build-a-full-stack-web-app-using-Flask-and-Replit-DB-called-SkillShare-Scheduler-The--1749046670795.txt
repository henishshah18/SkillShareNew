I want you to build a full stack web app using Flask and Replit DB called SkillShare Scheduler.
The goal is to let users offer skill sessions, request skill sessions, and track their sessions in their own profile calendar.

üîß üìã TASKS TO COMPLETE
1. ‚úÖ Authentication
Allow users to sign up (username, email, password)

Allow login and logout via Flask sessions

Store user credentials in Replit DB securely (don‚Äôt store raw passwords)

After login, redirect to /profile

2. ‚úÖ Offer a Skill Session (Form on /offer)
Fields:

Title

Skill (dropdown or text)

Description

Session Type: Online or Offline (radio or dropdown)

Session Date Options:

Presets: Weekdays, Weekends

Custom Dates: allow selecting multiple dates

For custom, allow multiple time ranges (e.g. 10AM‚Äì12PM, 2PM‚Äì4PM)

Add a ‚Äú+‚Äù button to dynamically add more time ranges (start-end)

Save all submitted sessions to Replit DB under the logged-in user

Ensure all previous input is preserved if the form has errors

3. ‚úÖ Request a Skill Session (Form on /request)
Fields:

Skill you want

Preferred session type (online/offline)

Custom dates (multiple date picker)

Preferred time ranges (same UI as offer form)

Save the request to DB under the user‚Äôs name

4. ‚úÖ Validation and Error Handling
Do not allow past dates or time ranges that are earlier than current time

If an error occurs:

Show an error message in red

Preserve all previously entered form values

Use datetime.now() and compare against user input

5. ‚úÖ Session Calendar + Profile Page (/profile)
Show the logged-in user:

All sessions they‚Äôve offered

All sessions they‚Äôve requested

Display as cards or in a table with:

Title / Skill / Mode / Date(s) / Time Ranges

Group by upcoming and past sessions

6. ‚úÖ Home Page (/)
If logged in:

Show welcome message

Links to:

Offer a Skill

Request a Skill

My Profile

Logout

If not logged in:

Show welcome + Sign Up / Login buttons

7. ‚úÖ Templates and Structure
Use Jinja2 for all templates

Create clean files:

templates/offer.html, request.html, profile.html, login.html, signup.html, index.html

static/style.css with minimal styling

Include navigation bar for easy user flow

8. ‚úÖ Data Format Suggestion
Store sessions in this format:

python
Copy
Edit
{
  "user": "johndoe",
  "title": "Intro to Figma",
  "skill": "Figma",
  "description": "...",
  "mode": "Online",
  "dates": ["2025-06-05", "2025-06-07"],
  "time_ranges": [["10:00", "12:00"], ["14:00", "16:00"]],
  "timestamp": "created_at"
}
