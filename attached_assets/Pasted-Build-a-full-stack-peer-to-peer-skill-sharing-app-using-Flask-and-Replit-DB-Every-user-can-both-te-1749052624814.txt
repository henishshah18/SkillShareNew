Build a full-stack peer-to-peer skill-sharing app using Flask and Replit DB.

Every user can both teach and learn. There are no fixed roles.

The app must include the following:

🔐 1. Authentication
Signup, Login, Logout

Store user data in Replit DB securely

Use Flask sessions

🧑‍🎓 2. User Profile (/profile)
Each user profile should contain:

Name

Short bio

Skills I can teach (list of skill tags)

Skills I want to learn (tags)

Social media / GitHub links

Stats:

Sessions taught

Sessions attended

Average rating

Let users edit their profile anytime.

📆 3. Offer a Skill Session (/offer)
Select one of their teachable skills

Add:

Description

Availability (multiple dates, multiple time ranges)

Save these offers under the user profile

Validate: No past dates or malformed time

🔍 4. Request a Session (/request)
Choose a skill they want to learn

Enter:

Preferred date range(s)

Preferred time range(s)

System should:

Match users who offer that skill

Whose availability overlaps

Display matches with:

Name, rating, skill tags, links

“View Profile” and “Book” buttons

🤝 5. Booking a Session
Learner selects a matched user

Selects from their availability

Clicks “Book Session”

Session is stored in both users’ schedule

Availability slot is removed or marked as booked

⭐ 6. Ratings
After a session occurs:

Each user gets option to rate the other (1–10)

Store rating + optional feedback

Update average rating for each user

📊 7. Dashboard (/dashboard)
Show both:

Sessions offered (upcoming/past)

Sessions booked (upcoming/past)

Reviews given/received

📁 8. Pages and Routes
